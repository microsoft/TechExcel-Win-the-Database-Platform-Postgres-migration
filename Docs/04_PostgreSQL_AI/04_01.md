 <details markdown="block"> 
  <summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary> 

Before configuring AI services, the City of Metropolis needs relevant test data. By creating tables and inserting sample records, officials can validate the AI features on realistic data (for example, legal cases or citizen service requests).
In this task, you'll add a couple of tables to the **cases** database and populate them with sample data so you have information to work with as you review the extension's functionality.

1. Run the following commands to create the **cases** tables for storing law cases data:

    ```
    \i mslearn-pg-ai/Setup/SQLScript/initialize_dataset.sql;
    ```

1. Enter the following command to allow the extended display to be automatically applied:

    ```
    \x auto
    ```

    {: .important }
    >Enabling the extended display for query results in psql improves the readability of output for subsequent commands. 

1. Retrieve a sample of data from the **cases** table. This allows you to examine the structure and content of the data stored in the database.

    ```
    SELECT * FROM cases
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

### 04: Set up PGAdmin

 <details markdown="block"> 
  <summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary> 

Beyond command-line interfaces, the City of Metropolis benefits from a graphical tool for easier database management. pgAdmin streamlines administrative tasks, letting staff quickly configure AI capabilities.
In this task, after verifying connections via the Azure Cloud Shell, you'll switch to [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) — a robust, open-source platform for PostgreSQL administration and development. This step accelerates the city’s ability to configure and manage AI features.

Using pgAdmin makes it easier to explore the output and understand how the AI features work in PostgreSQL. 

1. Open a new tab, then go to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Under **Navigate**, select **Resource Groups**.

1. Select **ResourceGroup1**.

1. In the resource group, select the **Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server** resource.

    ![on8omp7m.jpg](../../media/on8omp7m.jpg)

1. Paste the value of **Server name** into the below text box. This will be used to connect to the server.

    @lab.TextBox(PGHOST)

    ![bpkrinpa.jpg](../../media/bpkrinpa.jpg)

1. On the service menu, under **Settings**, select **Connect**. Follow instructions in Azure Portal on how to connect to pgAdmin.

    ![Connecting to pgAdmin from Azure](../../media/pgAdmin-from-azure.png)

### 05: Install and configure the azure_ai extension

 <details markdown="block"> 
  <summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary> 

For advanced data processing, Metropolis must integrate Azure AI services directly within PostgreSQL. The `azure_ai` extension allows seamless interaction with Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Language services.
In this task, you will install the **azure_ai** extension into your database and set up connections to your Azure AI Services resources. Doing so enables direct communication for automated text analysis, summarizations, and more.

{: .note }
> You'll use **pgAdmin** for the following steps.

<!--Before using the **azure_ai** extension, you must install it into your database and configure it to connect to your Azure AI Services resources. The **azure_ai** extension allows you to integrate the Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Language services into your database. -->

{: .important }
> Before an extension can be installed and used in an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server database, it must be added to the server's **allowlist**, as described in [how to use PostgreSQL extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-extensions#how-to-use-postgresql-extensions).

To enable the extension in your database, follow these steps:

1. Enter the following command in the pgAdmin **Query** pane. 

    ```
    SHOW azure.extensions;
    ```

    {: .note }
    > This verifies the **azure_ai**, **vector**, **age** and **pg_diskann** extensions were successfully added to your server's **allowlist** by the Bicep deployment script that ran when setting up your environment.

1. Select the **Execute script** button.

    ![9es8tm4z.jpg](../../media/9es8tm4z.jpg)

1. Your output will look similar to the following:

    ![4rrxndst.jpg](../../media/4rrxndst.jpg)

1. Install the **azure_ai** extension using the [CREATE EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html) command. Overwrite the previous query used with the following:

    ```
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS azure_ai;
    ```

{: .important }
> **CREATE EXTENSION** loads a new extension into the database by running its script file. This script typically creates new SQL objects such as functions, data types, and schemas. An error is thrown if an extension of the same name already exists. Adding **IF NOT EXISTS** allows the command to execute without throwing an error if it’s already installed.

### 06: Explore the Azure AI schema

 <details markdown="block"> 
  <summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary> 
   
 Metropolis’s IT department needs to understand how AI services function within PostgreSQL to effectively manage user queries and automate tasks.

The **azure_ai** schema provides the framework for directly interacting with Azure AI and ML services from your database. It contains functions for setting up connections to those services and retrieving them from the **settings** table, also hosted in the same schema. The **settings** table provides secure storage in the database for endpoints and keys associated with your Azure AI and ML services.

{: .important }
> Review the schema: [Configure the azure_ai extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/generative-ai-azure-overview#configure-the-azure_ai-extension)

- Review the functions defined in the **azure_ai** schema. 

| Schema |  Name  | Result data type | Argument data types | Type  |
|:----------|:-------------|:------------------|:----------------------|:------|
|  azure_ai | get_setting | text      | key text      | func |
|  azure_ai | set_setting | void      | key text, value text | func |
|  azure_ai | version  | text      |           | func |

{: .important }
> Because the connection information for Azure AI services, including API keys, is stored in a configuration table in the database, the **azure_ai** extension defines a role called **azure_ai_settings_manager** to ensure this information is protected and accessible only to users who have been assigned that role. This role enables reading and writing of settings related to the extension. 

---

#### Explore the Azure AI functions

Only members of the **azure_ai_settings_manager** role can invoke the **azure_ai.get_setting()** and **azure_ai.set_setting()** functions. In an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server, all admin users (those with the **azure_pg_admin** role assigned) are also assigned the **azure_ai_settings_manager** role.

Once these settings are properly configured, Metropolis can quickly integrate cognitive services—for example, to process lengthy legal documents or citizen requests—directly in its database.

To demonstrate how you use the **azure_ai.set_setting()** and **azure_ai.get_setting()** functions, configure the connection with your Azure OpenAI resource.

1. Go to the tab where Cloud Shell is open, minimize the Cloud Shell pane, then select the **ResourceGroup1** breadcrumb link.

    ![r46paieg.jpg](../../media/r46paieg.jpg)

1. Select the **Azure OpenAI** resource.

    ![jo30kfup.jpg](../../media/jo30kfup.jpg)

1. On the Azure OpenAI resource page, in the service menu, under the **Resource Management** section, select **Keys and Endpoint**.

1. Enter the value for **KEY 1** in the below textbox:

    `@lab.TextBox(API_KEY)`

1. Enter the value for **Endpoint**:

    `@lab.TextBox(ENDPOINT)`

    ![Screenshot of the Azure OpenAI service's Keys and Endpoints page is displayed, with the KEY 1 and Endpoint copy buttons highlighted by red boxes.](./instructions282962/azure-openai-keys-and-endpoints.png)

    {: .important }
    > You can use either **KEY 1** or **KEY 2**. Always having two keys allows you to securely rotate and regenerate keys without causing service disruption.

1. Once you have your endpoint and key, maximize the **pgAdmin** window.

1. Enter the following in the **Query** pane to add your values to the configuration table:

    ```sql
    SELECT azure_ai.set_setting('azure_openai.endpoint', '@lab.Variable(ENDPOINT)');
    SELECT azure_ai.set_setting('azure_openai.subscription_key', '@lab.Variable(API_KEY)');
    ```

    {: .warning }
    > This code block uses your input from the above text boxes for **KEY 1** and **Endpoint**. 

1. Select the **Execute script** button on the toolbar. The input and output should look similar to the following.

    ![ew9kd8ez.jpg](../../media/ew9kd8ez.jpg)

1. Verify the settings were written into the **azure_ai.settings** table. Enter the following, then select **Execute script**:

    ```sql
    SELECT azure_ai.get_setting('azure_openai.endpoint');
    ```

1. Enter the following, then select **Execute script**:

    ```sql
    SELECT azure_ai.get_setting('azure_openai.subscription_key');
    ```

    ![h9dxoetd.jpg](../../media/h9dxoetd.jpg)

    The **azure_ai** extension is now connected to your Azure OpenAI account.

---

#### Review the Azure OpenAI schema

The **azure_openai** schema provides the ability to integrate the creation of vector embedding of text values into your database using Azure OpenAI. Using this schema, you can [generate embeddings with Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/embeddings) directly from the database to create vector representations of input text, which can then be used in vector similarity searches, as well as consumed by machine learning models. 

The schema contains a single function, **create_embeddings()**, with two overloads. One overload accepts a single input string, and the other expects an array of input strings.

Review the details of the functions in the **azure_openai** schema: [Configure OpenAI endpoint and key](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/generative-ai-azure-openai#configure-openai-endpoint-and-key)

The documentation shows the two overloads of the **azure_openai.create_embeddings()** function, allowing you to review the differences between the two versions of the function and the types they return. 

1. Enter the following query and select **Execute script**:

    ```sql
    SELECT azure_openai.create_embeddings('text-embedding-3-small', 'Sample text for PostgreSQL Lab') AS vector;
    ```

    ![3204fmnv.jpg](../../media/3204fmnv.jpg)

    {: .note }
    > This is a simplified example of using the function, creating a vector embedding for a sample query. The **deployment_name** parameter is set to **embedding**, which is the name of the deployment of the **text-embedding-3-small** model in your Azure OpenAI service. 


{: .important }
>[Embeddings](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/generative-ai-overview#embeddings) are a concept in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) that involves representing objects such as words, documents, or entities, as [vectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/generative-ai-overview#vectors) in a multi-dimensional space.
>
> Embeddings allow machine learning models to evaluate how closely two pieces of information are related. This technique efficiently identifies relationships and similarities between data, allowing algorithms to identify patterns and make accurate predictions.
>
> The **azure_ai** extension allows you to generate embeddings for input text. To enable the generated vectors to be stored alongside the rest of your data in the database, you must install and [enable the vector extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/how-to-use-pgvector#enable-extension). However, that’s outside the scope of this exercise.
