# Exercise 03: PostgreSQL Migration 

## Scenario 

The City of Metropolis is dedicated to enhancing public services and administrative efficiency to meet the growing demands of its citizens. Faced with outdated document management systems and time-consuming administrative tasks, the city has embarked on a digital transformation journey.

- Create an Azure Database for PostgreSQL server in Azure. 
- Create a virtual network, gateway, and VPN connection in Azure.
